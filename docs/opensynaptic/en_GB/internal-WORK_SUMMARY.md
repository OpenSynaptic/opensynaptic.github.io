# Work Summary: OpenSynaptic Bidirectional Driver Completion

## Scope

This document summarizes the protocol-layer cleanup and bidirectional communication implementation work across transport, physical, and application drivers.

---

## Completed Work

### 1) Protocol architecture cleanup

- Removed six redundant drivers from `services/transporters`.
- Refocused `TransporterService` to pure L7 application-layer behavior.
- Improved driver discovery behavior in `LayeredProtocolManager`.
- Related report: `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`.

### 2) Bidirectional capability implementation

`listen()` support is now implemented across all target drivers:

- L4 transport: `udp`, `tcp`, `quic`, `iwip`, `uip`
- PHY layer: `uart`, `rs485`, `can`, `lora`
- L7 application: `mqtt`

Related report: `docs/reports/drivers/bidirectional-capability.md`.

### 3) Validation tooling and tests

- Added `scripts/audit_driver_capabilities.py` for driver capability audits.
- Added `scripts/integration_test.py` for integration coverage.
- Added runtime invocation checks and usage examples.
- Added layer diagnostics tooling for troubleshooting.

### 4) Documentation deliverables

- `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`
- `docs/reports/drivers/bidirectional-capability.md`
- `docs/reports/drivers/final-capability-audit.md`
- `docs/guides/drivers/quick-reference.md`
- `WORK_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Outcome Metrics

| Metric | Initial | Final | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Drivers with send support | 10/10 | 10/10 | Maintained |
| Drivers with receive/listen support | 0/10 | 10/10 | Complete |
| Fully bidirectional drivers | 0/10 | 10/10 | Complete |
| Redundant drivers | 6 | 0 | Removed |
| Integration test pass rate | 0/8 | 8/8 | Complete |

## Unified Listener Contract

```python
def listen(config: dict, callback: callable):
    """
    Blocking listener loop.

    Args:
        config: Driver-specific listener configuration.
        callback: Called on every received payload.
    """
```

Common behavior implemented by drivers:

- Long-running, blocking listener loop (run in a background thread/task).
- Callback invocation immediately after packet/frame receive.
- Protocol-specific receive method hidden behind a shared contract.

## Driver Implementation Notes

| Driver | Receive model | Implementation note |
|---|---|---|
| UDP | Connectionless socket | `recvfrom()` loop |
| TCP | Connection-oriented socket | `accept()` then `recv()` |
| QUIC | Async streams | `asyncio` + `aioquic` |
| UART | Serial stream | frame extraction (STX/ETX) |
| RS485 | Hardware-backed | driver `receive()` loop |
| CAN | Hardware-backed | bus frame receive |
| LoRa | Hardware-backed | radio receive |
| MQTT | Broker callback | subscribe + callback dispatch |

---

## Verification Snapshot

- Driver capability audit: all target drivers report complete send + receive support.
- Integration validation: full test suite pass (`8/8`).
- Runtime invocation checks: transmit, dispatch, receive, and handshake flow verified.

- `src/opensynaptic/core/transport_layer/protocols/tcp.py`
- `src/opensynaptic/core/transport_layer/protocols/quic.py`
- `src/opensynaptic/core/transport_layer/protocols/iwip.py`

- `src/opensynaptic/core/physical_layer/protocols/can.py`
- `src/opensynaptic/core/physical_layer/protocols/lora.py`
- `src/opensynaptic/services/transporters/drivers/mqtt.py`

### Tooling and diagnostics

- `scripts/audit_driver_capabilities.py`
- `scripts/integration_test.py`
- `scripts/test_runtime_invoke.py`
- `scripts/example_bidirectional.py`
- `scripts/diagnose_layers.py`

---

## Quick Validation Commands

```powershell
python -u scripts/audit_driver_capabilities.py
python -u scripts/integration_test.py
python -u scripts/test_runtime_invoke.py
```

Expected results:

- All target drivers marked complete.
- Integration suite passes.
- Runtime invocation path reports successful end-to-end operation.

---

## Design Decisions

- `listen()` is used as the cross-driver receive contract to represent continuous listening semantics.
- Callback-based delivery is preferred for low overhead and immediate event handling.
- A shared callback shape across drivers simplifies protocol switching in application code.
- Listener loops are intended for background threads/tasks to avoid blocking control flow.

---

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] All targeted drivers implement send and listen behavior.
- [x] Shared callback contract is consistently applied.
- [x] Integration and capability audit scripts are available.
- [x] Driver reference documentation is published.
- [ ] Optional performance tuning can be extended as needed.
- [ ] Optional connection pooling can be evaluated per protocol.

## Consolidated Internal Status Snapshot

This section preserves the high-value points that were previously split across multiple temporary status files.

### ID lease implementation and validation

- ID lease policy documentation was completed in `docs/ID_LEASE_SYSTEM.md` and `docs/ID_LEASE_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.
- Verification/testing artifacts exist in project root: `test_id_lease_system.py`, `verify_deployment.py`.
- Internal review previously reported a full pass across allocation, reconnection, adaptive lease behavior, metrics emission, and persistence workflows.

### Integration and operational notes

- Performance stats report interval was tuned to reduce noisy log output in continuous runs.
- Integration and capability audit paths were standardized around:
  - `scripts/integration_test.py`
  - `scripts/audit_driver_capabilities.py`
- Driver receive/listen support was validated across target transport, physical, and application layers.

### Documentation consolidation decision

- Replaced several overlapping internal progress docs with this single retained summary.
- For canonical user-facing references, use:
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/INDEX.md`
  - `docs/releases/`
  - `docs/reports/`
